Project text should probably take up the majority of the screen. Bold and larger titles for each project, followed by
a brief informational paragraph to follow.

Personal Website:
    After gaining valuable experience in frontend web development from interning with FactSet this past summer, I
    decided to put my skills to the test in making my first personal website. The website makes heavy use of Bootstrap
    for formatting and styling, as well as for making it responsive.

Alert Builder:
    During my 12-week Software Engineering Internship with FactSet, I went from knowing nothing about web development to
    building my own frontend web application. I started the internship by learning the basics of web development, such
    as JavaScript (ES6), HTML5, and CSS. I then learned the fundamentals of AngularJS, Git, as well as other
    FactSet-specific tools and libraries. I used what I had learned to start and see to completion a web application
    called Alert Builder. Alert Builder is an internal tool for Product Developers to easily and efficiently design
    custom alert cards to be used in the new alerting infrastructure in the web version of FactSet's Workstation
    software.

Data Structures Trivia Game:
    For the final project of my Data Structures course, I co-developed a quiz game with Data Structures trivia questions
    in the form of a Java Applet. The player goes through a set of randomized multiple choice questions, and has 60 seconds to answer
    them. The game keeps track of how many the player gets right and wrong, and tells the player after each question
    whether or not they answered in correctly. This project allowed me to put my knowledge of Data Structures and
    Object-Oriented programming to use, and also helped in studying for the final exam!
