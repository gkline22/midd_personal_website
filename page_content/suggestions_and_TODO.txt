The following is a list of suggestions to implement into the site:

From Alex:

-   Consider making it so you can see SOME txt content when you land on the page. Right now, if you show up on the
    homepage or the about me page, you don’t see anything without scrolling and it’s not necessarily intuitive that you
    have to scroll. Not sure how to format this, but you want to be able to see SOMETHING content-wise as soon as you
    land on the page.

-   In your “About Me” page, you have a few links in the text, but they just appear as plain black text until you hover
    over. Consider making hyperlinked text appear slightly different so people know there’s clickable content there.

-   The text on your homepage is a tad hard to read against that background. Maybe switch the pics from your landing page
    and your projects page? Just because there’s more text on the former.

-   Consider adding a period after “I’m Gray”

-   Make sure the alignment formatting is consistent. Might be a little funky that your about me paragraphs are aligned
    to center and your projects paragraphs are aligned hard left.

-   In mobile width, make some more clickable options other than the dropdown. Like make it obvious where you can click
    to go to other pages.
